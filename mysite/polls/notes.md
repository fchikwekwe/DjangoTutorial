# Ideas for test cases

- When adding new toppings to pizza, check if topping exists
- check size of array
- check created on and updated on
- check to make sure pizza is the right price
    - small vs large
- check that correct toppings were added to pizza 

- create pizza helper function so that we have something to test on more efficiently
